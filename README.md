By Srujay Korlakunta and Vineeth Yeevani. Coded for the [Mobile Developers of Berkeley](http://mobiledevsberkeley.edu) training program.

This is a simple app that allows users to search for Pokemon in a variety of ways, emulating a real PokeDex.

Some of the features included in the app:
* Users can search for Pokemon by name, number, minimum attack points, minimum defense points, or minimum health points.
* Search results can be viewed in a list view or image view
* Profile pages for each Pokemon, which include name, number, image, stats, and a Google search view.
* Favorites view for each user, which allows you to save your favorite Pokemon.
